# Compressall

A library for converting and compressing any file you throw at it. Ideal for websites where diverse file types are uploaded!

## Compression

Compress images, video, and audio to your preferred settings! You can adjust the settings used or go with the defaults set up.

## Conversion

Including:

* JPG -> PNG
* DOC -> TXT
* RTF -> PDF
* MP3 -> WAV
* MOV -> MP4

## Features

Use a whitelist or blacklist for file types, support Windows or Linux (Windows currently tested), and convert based on extension or general file type (e.g. `'png' => 'jpg'` or `'image' => 'jpg'`!

## Libraries used

* FFMPEG
* Image Magick
* Libre Office

You'll need to install these yourself, but `compressall.php` tells you which files you need.
